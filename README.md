📌About Us

We are a drug discovery team with an interest in the development of publicly available open-source customizable cheminformatics tools
to be used in computer-assisted drug discovery. We belong to the Laboratory of Bioactive Research and Development (LIDeB) of the
National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. Our research group is focused on computer-guided drug repurposing and rational discovery
of new drug candidates to treat epilepsy and neglected tropical diseases.

**It is a free web-application for Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) Substrate Prediction**

The volume of distribution at steady state (VDss) is an important pharmacokinetic
parameter that determines, along with clearance, the half-life of a compound. It
is proportional to the quantity of the chemical distributed into body tissues.
